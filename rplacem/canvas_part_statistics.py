    compute_vars: dictionary (string to int)
        says what level of information to compute and store for each variable.
        The keys for the computed variables are:

        The levels mean:
            0: not computed
            1: basic variables are computed
            2: images are created and stored in the form of 2d numpy arrays of pixels containing color indices.
                Variables based on these images are also computed
            3: these pixel arrays are transformed to images and stored. Also makes a movie from stored images.
