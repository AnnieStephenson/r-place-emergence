    identifies transitions in a cpart.
    
    parameters
    ----------
    cpart : CanvasPart object
        The CanvasPart object for which we want to calculate the instability
    t_lims : 1d array-like of floats
        time intervals in which the pixel states are studied. Must be ordered in a crescent way, start at 0, and be regularly spaced
    testvariable : 1d array-like of floats
        The variable on which cutoffs will be applied to detect transitions
    cutoff : float
        the lower cutoff on instability to define when a transition is happening
    cutoff_stable : float
        the higher cutoff on instability, needs to be not exceeded before and after the potential transition, for a validated transition
    len_stableregion : float 
        the duration (in seconds), before and after the potential transition, during which cutoff_stable must not be exceeded. 
        No stable intervals is looked for if len_stableregion <= 1 or cutoff_stable == cutoff.
    distfromtrans_stableregion: float
        maximal distance (in seconds) between the borders of the stable regions and those of the transition region.
    sliding_win: float
        The time (in seconds) added to distfromtrans_stableregion for the post-transtion stable period,
        to take into account the post-transition adaptation of the reference image over the sliding window

    returns
    -------
    (full_transition, full_transition_times) :
        full_transition is a 2d array. 
        full_transition[i] contains, for the found transition #i, the following size-6 array (of indices of the input instability array) :
            [beginning of preceding stable region, end of stable, 
            beginning of transition region, end of transition, 
            beginning of subsequent stable region, end of stable]
        (NB: a region of indices [n, m] includes all time intervals from n to m included)
        full_transition_times is the same array but with the times corresponding to those indices
